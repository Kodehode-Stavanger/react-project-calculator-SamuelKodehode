# React Project

## Calculator

### In this project, your task is to create a **Calculator** using React!

I have included a folder, "./material", where you can find images of the design we're aiming for, and a style guide to help you achieve it.

Requirements:

- Working basic calculator functionality and logic
- A final design as close to the images in "./material/design" as you can
- Use either CSS modules or React inline styling as your method for CSS styling.
- CSS Grid for the button layout
- Well thought out component hierarchy

Stretch goal (do if you have time):

- Working theme switch that switches between the themes in "./material/design"

Remember to use useState and props where necessary. If you get stuck, feel free to ask for help from me or your fellow students.

Like I mentioned during last React lecture, you will have **two** weeks to complete this project.

## Good luck!
